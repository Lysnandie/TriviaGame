# TriviaGame

Trivia Game uses JavaScript logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.
Created a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz with a limited countdown counter.

The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly and the player cannot pick more than one answer per question.
